 Bikeshare Data Project

Here we explore data for the following three cities:

Chicago
Washington
New York City

In this project, I made use of python and it’s libraries like numpy and pandas to explore data related to bike share system of three major cities in US – Chicago, New York, Washington. It gives us stats with respect to month and day which we select. Like most frequent time of travel, most popular stations and trip duration. It also displays data of every station from start to end of our trip and user related stats like gender, most common and recent year of birth of riders.
